# require_serial: true in pre-commit configurations means that the hook must be run sequentially (one at a time) rather
# than in parallel with other hooks.
#
# This is particularly important for tools like mypy because:
#
# Mypy performs whole-project type checking and needs to analyze dependencies between files
# Running multiple instances of mypy simultaneously could lead to race conditions or inconsistent results
# Mypy maintains a cache of analysis results, and parallel runs might interfere with this cache
#
# By default, pre-commit tries to optimize performance by running hooks in parallel when possible. While this works well
# for simple hooks like code formatters that operate on individual files independently, it can cause issues with tools
# that need to understand the entire codebase as a single unit.
#
# In Particular, If you removed require_serial: true, you might occasionally see:
#
# Inconsistent type checking results
# Cache corruption
# Memory usage spikes from multiple mypy processes
# Race conditions when multiple instances try to write to the cache
#
# That's why it's recommended to keep require_serial: true for mypy hooks, even though it might make the pre-commit
# checks run slightly slower.
